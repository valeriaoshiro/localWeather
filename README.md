# Local Weather
Completed October 13, 2016
Edited August 21, 2020

This project figures out the location of the user and shows the local weather.


## Requirements
- I can see the weather in my current location.
- I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.
- I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

## Experience learned
- Learned how to get the userâ€™s location through their browser Geolocation.
- Learned how to use openweathermap.org api to find the local weather. 
- Used media query to make mobile friendly, and designed it with mobile first approach.
- Only used jQuery to access the api. The rest of the project was done in JavaScript.
- **Extra**: Added the feature where the user can enter a city to look for the weather. If there was more than one city with the same name, it showed that list and let the user choose which one they wanted. It also validates if the city they entered exists.
